## Description
This repository contains information and code on the project "Fake News Detection", developed during our Data Scientist training at DataScientest.

The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning to predict whether an article is real or fake news.

We use the fifth installment of the nela-gt dataset (nela-gt-2022), which is freely available [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/RBKVBM)

The dataset labels_all_2022.csv is stored in this repository. The other used stratified subsets of the data are available upon request.

This project was developed by the following team :
Dr. Elisa Hofmann
Amer Osmanovic
Ronny Storch

Mentor: Sarah LeNet
