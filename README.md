## Description
This repository contains information and code on the project "Fake News detection" from the DataScientest Bootcamp "Data Scientist" cohort April 2023. We use the nela-gt-2022 dataset and develop machine learning models to predict whether an article is real or fake news.

The dataset labels_all_2022.csv is stored in this repository. The other used datasets are available upon request.
