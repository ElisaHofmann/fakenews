## Description
This repository contains information and code on the project "Fake News Detection", developed during our Data Scientist training at DataScientest.

In this project we aim to predict fake news and real news from the title and content of an article. Thus, we have a classification problem that we tackle with data science techniques.

We use a subset of the fifth installment of the nela-gt datasets, containing 2 datasets:
    
    1. nela-gt-22.db (SQLite 3 database containing the collected articles)
    2. labels_all_2022.csv (document with label and additional information on the sources)

The nela-gt datasets have been created with scientific rigor and are freely available. The dataset labels_all_2022.csv is stored in this repository. The used stratified subset of the data is available upon request.

This project was developed by the following team: Dr. Elisa Hofmann, Amer Osmanovic, Ronny Storch

Mentor: Sarah Le Net
