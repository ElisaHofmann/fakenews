## Description
This repository contains information and code on the project "Fake News Detection", developed during our Data Scientist training at DataScientest.

The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques to predict whether an article is real or fake news.

We use the fifth installment of the nela-gt dataset (nela-gt-2022). The dataset labels_all_2022.csv is stored in this repository. The used stratified subset of the data is available upon request.

This project was developed by the following team: Dr. Elisa Hofmann, Amer Osmanovic, Ronny Storch

Mentor: Sarah Le Net
